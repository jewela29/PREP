- definations:\
  **offset**: difference between the two indexes is the offset.
  
- **can we change size of array in c?**\
  In C language array has a fixed size meaning once the size is given to it, it cannot be changed i.e. 
  you can’t shrink it neither can you expand it. The reason was that for expanding if we change the size we can’t be sure 
  ( it’s not possible every time) that we get the next memory location to us as free. 
  The shrinking will not work because the array, when declared, gets memory statically, and thus compiler is the only one to destroy it.
  
- **types of indexing**
  0 (zero-based indexing): The first element of the array is indexed by a subscript of 0
  1 (one-based indexing): The first element of the array is indexed by the subscript of 1
  n (n-based indexing): The base index of an array can be freely chosen. Usually, programming languages allowing n-based indexing also 
  allow negative index values, and other scalar data types like enumerations, or characters may be used as an array index.

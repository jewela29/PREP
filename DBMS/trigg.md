## When to Use SQL Triggers?
Triggers share a lot in common with stored procedures. Still, compared to stored procedures they are limited in what you can do. Therefore, I prefer to have one stored procedure for insert/update/delete and make all checks and additional actions there.

Still, that is not always the option. If you inherited a system or you simply donâ€™t want to put all the logic in the stored procedures, then triggers could a solution for many problems you might have.
